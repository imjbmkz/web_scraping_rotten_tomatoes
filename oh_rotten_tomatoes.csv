Cary Darling,Houston Chronicle,"That rare summer movie with ideas as big as its ambition and budget...But ""Oppenheimer"" isn't a movie that is dependent on special effects for its power.

Justin Chang,Los Angeles Times,"One of the many satisfactions of Oppenheimer, Nolan’s intellectually thrilling and morally despairing new film, is that it succeeds in locating some of those conventions within another of his ingeniously constructed narrative labyrinths.","Full Review | Jul 19, 2023",Top Critics,2023-07-19,

Tara Brady,Irish Times,"The filmmaker’s technique generally counterpoints any caveats and script imperfections.

Robbie Collin,Daily Telegraph (UK),"It’s at once a speeding roller-coaster and a skin-tingling spiritual portrait; an often classically minded period piece that only Nolan could have made, and only now, after a quarter-century’s run-up.","Full Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Jul 19, 2023",Top Critics,2023-07-19,5/5
Clarisse Loughrey,Independent (UK),"Large swathes of the film play out as political thriller, the fuel in its engine being Downey Jr’s titanic colouring of Strauss, all boorishness and manipulative charm.","Full Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jul 19, 2023",Top Critics,2023-07-19,4/5
Jake Cole,Slant Magazine,Oppenheimer joins the ranks of Christopher Nolan’s best work not for preserving some essential inexplicability of nuclear physics but by undermining the idea of science’s objectivity.,"Full Review | Original Score: 3.5/4 | Jul 19, 2023",Top Critics,2023-07-19,3.5/4

Owen Gleiberman,Variety,"Cillian Murphy, with a thousand-yard beam, the half-smile of an intellectual rake, and a way of keeping everything close to the vest, gives a phenomenal performance as Oppenheimer, making him fascinating and multi-layered.","Full Review | Jul 19, 2023",Top Critics,2023-07-19,
Alison Willmore,New York Magazine/Vulture,"Its scope comes from Murphy’s haunted performance, and the way that the movie (with help from Ludwig Göransson’s panic attack of a score) submerges you in the mindset of its protagonist as though it can create a psychic connection to the past.","Full Review | Jul 19, 2023",Top Critics,2023-07-19,
